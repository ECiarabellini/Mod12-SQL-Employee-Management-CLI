Employee Management CLI

MSU Coding Bootcamp Module 12 Challenge: SQL Employee Tracker

Credits:
- addDepartment example provided by tutor

- classmate advised how to use forEach method to turn the SQL query results into array to be used for inquirer prompt lists

- ChatGPT helped me to nest the SQL callback functions in updateEmployeeRole to make the code synchronous. 


Future development: 
- add express server for potential web application (see './discarded_files' for work done previously)
- Use separate file that contains functions for performing the SQL queries, using a constructor function or class for organizing. 
- Add user input validation
